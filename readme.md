#Alton Live GPS Tracker

This application is built with [Packfire Framework for PHP](http://mauris.sg/packfire).

Alton is a live GPS coordinates receiver and map display. The application accepts longitude and latitude in the receive() API and displays it in real-time on Bing Map. 

On top of being a GPS debugger tool at RHyMeS Centre, School of InfoComm Technology, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Alton is also a demo application for Packfire Framework for PHP.

Please get your own Bing Map key and insert it into `app.yml` before running your application.
